# CHAPTER 6 â€“ CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION
# Sometimes we want to play PUBG on our phone if the day is Sunday.
# Sometimes we order Ice Cream online if the day is sunny.
# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.
# All these are decisions which depend on a condition being met.
# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met.
